# portfolio
I am using this repository to showcase some of my developer projects primarily focusing on Front End Development using React, JS,TS, HTML, and CSS. You will find separate sections below for each of the projects included in this portfolio. I intend to discuss the technology used for development, the purpose that the project served, a lessons learned, and also a brief description on how the project works and what functionality it brings. I will end this overview by saying that these projects may still be in development and have features that are yet to be implemented.
